        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            As a student at Code the Dream, I combine a professional background in metrology with the creative perspective of an art lover.
            This unique mix allows me to approach technology with both extreme precision and innovative thinking. 
            I am a highly persistent individual, fueled by an unwavering enthusiasm for learning and staying at the forefront of innovation. 
            Beyond my formal studies, I am constantly implementing personal projects—from building cloud-based infrastructures to advanced home automation. 
            By integrating AI and emerging technologies into my daily life, 
            I actively seek to solve real-world problems through hands-on technical execution.
